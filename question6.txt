Sum of Even Fibonacci Numbers
Write a program in a Object Orientated Programming language of your choice to calculate the sum of the first
100 even-valued Fibonacci numbers. Consider efficiency and demonstrate good coding practices. (using python)

# I am using Python #

def sum_even_fibonacci(limit=100):
    even_fibs = []
    # taking first 2 even Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 2, 8

    while len(even_fibs) < limit:
        even_fibs.append(a)
        a, b = b, 4 * b + a
    
    return sum(even_fibs)

print("sum of first 100 even Fibonacci numbers: ", sum_even_fibonacci())
